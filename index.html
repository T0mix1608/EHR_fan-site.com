            <p id="description">
                Endless Host Roles (EHR), the largest host-only mod for Among Us, was created by the ingenious Gurge44. 
                Initially named TOHE Plus (TOHE+), as it was a modification of TOHE (Town Of Host), the mod now features 
                significantly more roles and options than its first version, and Gurge continues to update it regularly.
            </p>
